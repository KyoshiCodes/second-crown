# Handoff (2026-09-24)

Read `AGENTS.md` then this file.

## Live

`http://129.153.17.72:8787/` · `pm2 restart sc-cloud` · repo `KyoshiCodes/second-crown` `main`.
Last docs+upkeep merge includes PRs through **#77**.

## Owner machine

Windows clone: `C:\Projects\second-crown-claude`
Always `git fetch` before checkout. If `docs/HANDOFF.md` is dirty: `git checkout -- docs/HANDOFF.md`.
Gemini doc branches often conflict; rebase onto `origin/main`, `--theirs` on the four doc files during rebase, `git push --force-with-lease`.

## Active Bakeoff (bakeoff/gemini-hud)

- **Inhabited Shell HUD & Stamped Tabs**:
  - Lectern and realm cards: inner gold edge (`inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(212, 163, 89, 0.42)`), idle candle flicker (`sc-candle-flicker`), and faint dust motes via `InhabitedOverlay` (`pointer-events: none`).
  - Stamped metal tabs: brushed bronze plate gradient, beveled inset highlights, active tab lantern tick with animated ticking lantern flame.
  - Primer banner: royal wax seal badge, deckled vellum page edge seam, and high-contrast readable buttons ("Done with this step", "Skip primer").
  - Form inputs untouched (not restyled to white).
  - All click-through and button actions 100% preserved.

## Verify

```
npm test
npm run test -w @second-crown/render
npm run build -w @second-crown/app
```

## Invariants that still bite

- HUD chrome palette: `<html data-chrome>` via `ThemeDock.tsx`, key `sc-chrome`. Buttons default dark from `theme.css`.
- World atlas pans by drag. 6px slop keeps clicks working. Recenter resets.

- Sim is 10 Hz, deterministic, offline catch-up. No sim on `server/`.
- Column clashes use the column, not the home army.
- Presentation branches must leave `git diff main -- packages/sim server` empty.
- One study at a time. Academy only shortens *new* studies.
- Treat wounded is 4 food + 50 ticks → 1 militia.
- Wall HP already includes gate HP; do not add them twice in copy.
- Vision ≠ rim tower count. See DEV-NOTES.
